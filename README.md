Arjun Shah Personal Portfolio Website

NOTE: This project is still a work in progress regarding content and style.

In this project, I sought to make my own website utilizing languages such as html, css, and javascript.
The first reason for creating this website was to apply some of the frontend skills I learned in my previous
internship at the startup CaseCtrl. The second reason is that I wanted to be able to show case some of my
projects and research experiences to those that are interested in mathematics, computer science, deep learning, etc,.

While creating this project, I referred to this video by freeCodeCamp.org https://youtu.be/_xkSvufmjEs. 
I found their tutorial to be extremely beginner friendly and it gave me a good backbone when it came to creating my own website. 
Some challenges I faced while creating this website were simply due to me not being super fluent in css. 
However, my "googling skills" definitely flourished throughout this project and is now a valuable tool I can add to my software engineering skillset.

The website can be run locally by using the Live Server extension that VSCode provides in their marketplace or 
can be accessed through the link arjunshahh.com! I am running my website through a digital ocean droplet.
